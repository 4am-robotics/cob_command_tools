* -
* merge
* teleop keyboard
* Merge branch 'master' into scriptserver
* performance tuning
* teleoperation with keyboard
* update documentation
* bugfix in teleop
* ramp filter for base_controller
* teleop with deadman and run button
* improved joystick handling
* renamed launch file
* modification on cob3-2
